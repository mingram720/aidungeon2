# AIDungeon2-Uncensored

This is a fork of the original AIDungeon 2 Uncensored fork, with temperature changed to enhance story cohesion. Mainly for personal use and experimentation. 

## This fork removes the profanity filter entirely.

Please note: if you are offended at all by the output that is produced, I encourage you to visit the upstream repository instead, and run that repo. I have no control over what output is produced, and neither does upstream. You have been warned.
